# Zero-Knowledge Proof Demos

This repository contains simple demonstration examples of how easy it is start with building zkApps using some famous protocols like MINA, RISC Zero, zkSync, etc...

## Overview

Zero-knowledge proofs allow a prover to demonstrate truth without revealing private information. They will be a critical enabler of privacy and scalability for blockchains.

## Contents
The following examples are included:

- Simple Math - Arithmetic circuits and proofs


## Getting Started

To run the examples locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Try out the different demo scenarios

## TODO
- [ ] Add more examples using Risc0, zkSync, etc...
- [ ] Add seperate ```README.md``` for each folder for ease of understanding
- [ ] Add relevant links for exaploring and learning ZK
- [ ] Enjoy the moment
