# Zero-Knowledge Proof Demos

This repository contains simple demonstration examples of using zero-knowledge proofs on the Mina and RiscZero blockchains.

## Overview

Mina is a privacy-first blockchain protocol optimized for zero-knowledge proofs.
RiscZero is a lightweight blockchain computer focused on computations with zk-proofs.
Zero-knowledge proofs allow a prover to demonstrate truth without revealing private information. They will be a critical enabler of privacy and scalability for blockchains.

This repo showcases basic SNARK operations to give a sense of the developer experience.
